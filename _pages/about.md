About me
======

Hi!

I'm Mar, a quantitative sociologist from Almería (Spain), one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. I'm a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) and for the Fall semester 2022, also a Visiting Fellow at INVEST Flagship (Turku). 

I'm interested in broad topics such as social stratification, with a particular focus on educational and health inequalities. In my research I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs. You can learn more about my research [here](https://marespadafor.github.io/research/).

I also have a keen interest on policy analysis. I'm a Junior Fellow of Future Policy Lab (FPL), a recently-created think tank whose aim is to shape the public debate in Spain on some of the most pressing issues of our time. My research has been featured in [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html), and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain.

If you work on similar topics or are interested in my work, please do get in touch via email (maria.canizares@eui.eu). You can also follow me on twitter ( @marespadafor), where I post about sociology, my travels and whatever is on my mind that day, really.
